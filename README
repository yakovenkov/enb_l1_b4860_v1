OVERVIEW

This is quite simple but almost working LTE L1 implementation for the famous NXP's B4860 SoC.

It successfully runs on top of B4860QDS board and other B4860-based modules via commercial RRU
connected via CPRI link.

Currently this L1 supports only a subset of LTE RAN features:
  - FDD 3MHz and FDD 5MHz modes
  - SISO and [almost untested] 2T2R configurations

BUILD

Build requirements:

1. Freescale CodeWarrior for StarCore SC3900 (version 10.9.0 build 451)

2. Board-dependent initialization files:

     b486x_all_heap.c
     b486x_default_stacks.c
     b486x_init.c
     b486x_shared_mem.c
     smartdsp_init.c

   Create and put them to os_config/ dir.

Build process:

1. Apply patch (smartdsp_os.diff) to SmartDSP OS sources to get all the things working as expected.

2. Create B4860 workspace and import CW project into it. It has already configured build targets:

     Debug - full debugging without optimization
     Release - full optimization without debug code
     Release_Export - Release + prepare unique .bin firmware image based on GIT ref

   You can use following defines to customize code a bit:

     USE_DIRECT_LOG=1 use direct logging to PPC side (eliminates snprintf overhead on SC3900 side)
     USE_CPRI=<0..7> use CPRI number at initialization (default 0)
     DEBUG_BUILD=1 enable debug features
     DEBUG_OPT_OFF=1 disable optimization for debugging

3. Take a bottle of beer and try to build.

4. Don't forget to build PowerPC part of the software (FAPI/IPC libs and some other B4860 utils).
